# The Minimum Weakly Connected Dominating Set Problem

## Overview

This project explores the **Minimum Weakly Connected Dominating Set (MWCDS) problem**, a variation of the **Dominating Set problem** in graph theory. The goal is to find the smallest set of nodes that dominate the graph while ensuring weak connectivity. 

To solve this problem, the following approaches have been implemented:

- **Greedy Algorithm**
- **Genetic Algorithm**
- **PULP Solver** (for exact optimization)
